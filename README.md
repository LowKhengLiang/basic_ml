# Basic Machine Learning Projects
These are the Machine Learning projects that I have practiced and explored to teach myself how to build simple machine learning models using Python programming.
They taught me data exploration, data visualization, supervised/unsupervised learning, ensemble models, and performance metrics evaluation.

# 1) Mobile Price Classification
The objective is to identify the mobile phone price range by training a suitable classification algorithm.
Data exploration, visualization, modeling and performance metrics are evaluated.

# 2) Wine Clustering
The objective is to familiarized with K-Means clustering and its relevant performance metrics in comparison to supervised learning.

# 3) Diabetes Prediction
The objective is to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not by comparing 2 classifiers, Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees.
Data exploration, visualization and modeling are done and the performance metrics are compared to identify the most suitable model for the dataset.
As false negatives will result in serious consequences in the medical industry, this project teachs me the importance of contextual understanding as a Data Scientist.

# 4) Galaxy Stars Classification
This project aims to introduce me to one of the ensemble learning technique: random forest classifiers to compare whether a single decision tree can outperform multiple decision trees.
Hyperparameter optimizations (depth and number of trees) are explored along with the traditional data exploration, visualization, modeling and performance metrics.
